Beginner (confidence is growing)
0 💩Knows nothing. Didn't even heared of it. - "WUT?"
1 😮Knows it exists and what it is about - "Oh yeah! I heard about it! I can be used to ..."
2/
</p>
<p>
Experimented (competence and over-confidence is growing)
2 😐Did it for a bit (a tutorial). - "OK... So this is how I do this! I am not sure I can use it for that"
3 😀Have been doing it for quite some time and is able to do most of it. - "To do this I know this is the way. "
3/
</p>

Over-confident and under-estimates experts. At the top of mount of stupidity.
4 😁Have a good knowledge about it and thinks it makes 
one a master ("I know this is THE best solution for this problem"). 
4/
